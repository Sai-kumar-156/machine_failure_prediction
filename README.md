# machine_failure_predict
Machine failure prediction is a system that analyzes operational data to detect potential machinery failures in advance. It not only predicts if a failure will occur but also identifies the specific type, such as power failure, overstrain, or heat-related issues.By continuously monitoring key parameters like temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear, the system identifies patterns that indicate potential failures. This allows maintenance teams to take proactive measures, reducing costly repairs and production halts. Using advanced algorithms and historical data, this model helps minimize unexpected downtime, improve maintenance planning, and enhance overall equipment performance. Additionally, integrating real-time data with predictive analytics enhances decision-making, ensuring machines operate at peak efficiency. Over time, the model can improve its accuracy by learning from new data, making it a valuable tool for industrial automation and reliability management.
