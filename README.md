# machine_failure_predict
Machine failure prediction is a system designed to anticipate potential failures in machinery by analyzing operational data. This predictive model not only forecasts whether a machine will fail but also identifies the specific type of failure, such as power failure, overstrain, or heat-related issues. By leveraging advanced algorithms and historical data, the system aims to prevent unplanned downtime, enhance maintenance scheduling, and optimize overall equipment efficiency.
